    <img src="../img/Coconut-Shrimp.jpg" alt="Coconut Shrimp image" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These coconut shrimp are rolled in a coconut beer batter before frying.
      Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce â€” I use orange marmalade,
      mustard, and horseradish mixed to taste for a dipping sauce.
